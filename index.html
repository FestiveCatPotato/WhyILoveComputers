    <h2> The computer tower itself </h2>
    <p> Building your own computer, while a very long process that might lead to frustration if you don't know what goes where, is something that I reccomend that you do at least once if you have the ability to and enjoy computers, as it allows you to get a better sense of what's going on when your computer does anything, which at least to me fascinates me, as something the size of my torso will most likely be able to simulate real life within a few centuries. It's mind boggling. </p>

    <h2> The programs that make it work </h2>
    <p> Programming is something that has captivated me since I first came across it on khan academy learning about javascript. I would spend hours and hours messing with it, and eventually create an infinitely looping highway with different color cars passing under see-through lights </p>

    <h2> The Internet </h2>
    <p> While the internet can have its dangers, if you know how to navigate it without viruses or anything, then you can get access to a limitless amount of time wasters and job opportunities.</p>
